WHAT Problem:
  I want to install library by using pip install xxx.
  But the terminal hints: 
  error: externally-managed-environment × This environment is externally managed 
  ╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install xyz, 
  where xyz is the package you are trying to install. 
  If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew, 
  use a virtual environment: python3 -m venv path/to/venv source path/to/venv/bin/activate python3 -m pip install xyz


WHY Problem exists?
  Hit PEP 668 (externally-managed environment), your Python blocks system-wide pip installs. 


Solution:
# 1) go to your project
cd /path/to/your_project

# 2) create a virtualenv (named .venv)
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3) activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4) upgrade pip (good practice)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# 5) install requests inside the venv
pip install requests

# 6) sanity check
python -c "import requests, sys; print('requests', requests.__version__, 'python', sys.version.split()[0])"

# You’ll see something like:
# requests 2.32.x python 3.14.x
